Visual Testing and Image Analysis Toolkit
This repository contains a collection of TypeScript files for visual testing and image analysis using various libraries such as @playwright/test, tesseract.js, @google-cloud/vision, and pixelmatch. The toolkit offers a wide range of functionalities including text extraction, logo detection, color comparison, and screenshot comparison.

Files Overview
analyze.ts: Implements functions using Google Cloud Vision API and Tesseract.js for tasks like label extraction, color analysis, and OCR (Optical Character Recognition).
colors.ts: Provides utility functions to convert color formats and compare colors.
visual.ts: Contains functions for visual comparison of images and screenshots using the Pixelmatch library.
Key Features
Image Label Extraction: Using Google Cloud Vision API to analyze images and extract labels.

Color Analysis: Functions to compare and analyze colors in different formats.

Text Extraction: Implements OCR with Google Cloud Vision and Tesseract.js to extract text from images.

Logo Detection: Extracts logos from images using Google Cloud Vision API.

Screenshot Comparison: Compares screenshots for visual differences using Pixelmatch.

Usage Examples

import { analyzeElementCornerScreenshots, extractTextWithGoogleVision } from './analyze';
import { rgbToHex, areTheseColorsVisuallyTheSame } from './colors';
import { diffScreenshots, captureScreenshot } from './visual';

// Example: Analyze corner colors of an element
await analyzeElementCornerScreenshots(page, 50, locator, 255, 0, 0);

// Example: Check if two colors are visually the same
const visuallySame = await areTheseColorsVisuallyTheSame('#ff0000', '#fe0000');

// Example: Capture a screenshot
const screenshot = await captureScreenshot(element);

// Example: Diff two screenshots
const numDiffPixels = await diffScreenshots(screenshotA, screenshotB);
